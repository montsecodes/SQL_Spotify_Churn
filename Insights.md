**Key Insights**
* Churned users generally show lower engagement, including fewer listening minutes and higher skip rates.
* Premium users show the highest churn rate, although they also represent a large share of the user base.

**_Dataset Analysis_**

* **How many users are in the dataset?**

8,000 users 

* **What percentage of users have churned?**

Approximately 26% of users have churned, indicating a moderate churn rate that requires investigation into engagement and retention drivers.

* **How does engagement differ between churned and active users?**

Churned users show slightly higher skip rates and marginally lower listening time, suggesting reduced engagement. While the difference is not extreme, the consistency of this pattern across multiple engagement metrics indicates early disengagement prior to churn.

* **Does subscription type influence churn?**

Premium subscribers exhibit the highest churn rate, followed by users on Family plans. However, Premium and Free plans also represent the largest portions of the user base, which may partially explain the higher churn volume. To better understand this pattern, further analysis comparing engagement levels and churn rates across subscription types would help determine whether churn is driven by usage behavior or subscription structure.

* **Which engagement level has the highest churn rate?**

Users with very low listening time show the highest churn rates, indicating that early disengagement is a strong predictor of churn. 
Additionally, users in the mid-engagement range also show elevated churn, suggesting opportunities for targeted retention strategies before disengagement becomes permanent.
Both of these categories have the highest ads average across all categories.

* **Which user segments should be prioritized for retention efforts?**

Users in very low category should be prioritized in retention efforts as they get more ads so they get a better experience and don’t leave the app


**Key Takeaways**
* Engagement metrics are strong indicators of churn risk.
* Early behavioral signals can help identify users likely to disengage.
* Subscription type alone does not fully explain churn as behavior matters more.
* SQL is a powerful tool for uncovering actionable insights from product data.
